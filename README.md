# Atlas-for-legacy-Windows

I want atlas to be avaliable on as many oses as possible. So I made this project. This is just Atlas, but compiled in .NET 2.0 instead of .NET 4.0. So it can run in Windows 2000, Windows ME and Windows 98 now.

**How to install?**
- Download the features.zip file from the main branch and extract it.
- Install both of the exes and then open the AtlasLegacy zip
